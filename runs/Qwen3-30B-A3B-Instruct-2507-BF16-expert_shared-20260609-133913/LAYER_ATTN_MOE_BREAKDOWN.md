# Per-decode-layer breakdown — no-lora vs LoRA(single) vs two-stream (Attn / MoE sublayers)

Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-BF16-expert_shared, GB300, TP4/EP4, bs16, **cuda-graph ON, decode**,
commit `526e0ae22`. One transformer layer inside an NVTX `step[DECODE bs=16]` (48 layers/step), GPU
main-stream (`tid 128`), packed by GPU-active time. Kernels attributed by name (position-assisted);
`shrink A` / `expand B` straddle q/k/v/o (attn) and shared_expert (MoE) and are split by position.

**Per layer: no-lora ~96 µs → LoRA-single ~158 µs (+63 µs, 1.65×).** Base compute (fmha, dense GEMM,
expert GEMM, allreduce) is ~unchanged by LoRA; the delta is the LoRA-added rows.

`two-stream Δ` = GPU-active time removed from the critical (main) stream by two-stream. **It is ~0 for
every group**: two-stream *overlaps* work (concurrent side stream), it does **not** reduce GPU-active
time — on this BF16 path only ~3% of LoRA moves to side streams (11 ms of ~360 ms, whole-trace). Its
real benefit is **wall-clock**: decode +17% (2125→2481 tok/s ≈ −23 µs/layer) via latency hiding.

## ① Attention sublayer:  base ~42 µs → LoRA ~55 µs  (+13 µs)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| attention fmha | 10.4 | 10.4 | ~0 | 0 | — | |
| dense GEMM nvjet (qkv/o) | ~24 | ~24 | ~0 | 0 | — | |
| allreduce (after attn) | ~8 | ~8 | ~0 | 0 | — | |
| LoRA qkv_b expand | 0 | 4.2 | +4.2 | ~0 | cuBLAS expand | |
| LoRA shrink A (q/k/v/o part) | 0 | ~4.2 | +4.2 | ~0 | fuse q/k/v shrink into one GEMM + cuBLAS | |
| LoRA expand B (o part) | 0 | ~5.0 | +5.0 | ~0 | cuBLAS; fuse fp32→bf16 cast into expand | |

## ② MoE sublayer:  base ~50 µs → LoRA ~96 µs  (+46 µs)

| group (µs/layer) | base | LoRA | Δ | two-stream Δ | optimization | MoE-decomp extra — components (µs/layer) | url |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MoE core (bmm expert GEMM / router / finalize) | 36.3 | 34.2 | ~0 | 0 | — | | |
| gate GEMM (nvjet) + allreduce (after MoE) | ~14 | ~14 | ~0 | 0 | — | | |
| routing (`routingCustom`) — **not LoRA-added** | 5.1 | 4.4 | −0.6 | 0 | — | | |
| **MoE-decomp extra** | 0 | **26.0** | **+26.0** | ~0 | in-MoE LoRA fold (bf16 = **NVFP4 sibling**, decomposed + missing-unfused-cubin wall → **NOT a port of FP8**; bf16-only CUTLASS-EVT GEMM1 epilogue, no quant to fuse into) + fuse routing/align/topk/elem | • **align/sort/scatter +10.2** (`moe_align_block_size_small_batch` 6.7 + `moe_lora_merged::fused_align_scatter` 3.5, latter LoRA-specific)<br>• **fused_moe +7.2** (expert GEMM, replaces `bmm`)<br>• **elem / copy / cast +3.9** (upcast / copy)<br>• **activation +3.2** (`moe::dev::activation`)<br>• **topk / pack +3.0** (`_fused_virtual_topk_ids`)<br>• **permute +2.4** (`moe::dev::permute`) | 1.

[opt2 — topk/pack: decode +5.6% bs16](https://github.com/yushengsu-thu/lora_perf_lora_profile/tree/main/runs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-BF16-expert_shared-20260609-133913/opt2) _(flag-only, no code commit)_<br>3. [opt3 — drop elem/upcast + lean `_get_lora_info`: no clear win](https://github.com/yushengsu-thu/sglang/commit/1536c6e4e65515f5ee7403c48b0726d55307d430) |
| LoRA MoE shrink (routed experts) | 0 | 9.2 | +9.2 | ~0 | fold into expert GEMM | | |
| LoRA shrink A (shared_expert part) | 0 | ~7.4 | +7.4 | ~0 | cuBLAS / fuse | | |
| LoRA MoE expand (routed experts) | 0 | 3.4 | +3.4 | ~0 | fold into expert GEMM | | |

(~+6 µs/layer of elementwise/reshape from the decomposed path is split across both sublayers. The
"MoE-decomp extra" components sum to ~+29 µs incl. routing≈0; the headline +26 µs excludes the LoRA
shrink/expand GEMM rows.)

## Where the +63 µs/layer goes
- **MoE sublayer ≈ +46 µs (73%)** — MoE-decomp extra (~+26 µs, biggest item **align/sort +10.2 µs**,
  larger than any single LoRA GEMM) + MoE LoRA shrink/expand (+13 µs) + shared_expert shrink (~+7 µs).
- **Attention sublayer ≈ +13 µs (21%)** — the q/k/v/o LoRA GEMMs.
- elementwise ≈ +6 µs. The decomp cluster is ~46% of the per-layer LoRA overhead.

## in-MoE fold vs (a) fusion — no double-counting
| absorbed by **in-MoE LoRA fold** | addressed only by **(a) fusion/removal** |
|---|---|
| `fused_moe` (7.2) + `activation` (3.2) + `permute` (2.4) + routed-expert LoRA shrink/expand (~13) ≈ **~25 µs** | `align/sort/scatter` (10.2) + `topk/pack` (3.0) + `elem/cast` (3.9) ≈ **~17 µs** |

→ **Stackable**: in-MoE fold (~−25 µs) + (a) align/topk/elem fusion (~−17 µs) ≈ **−42 µs of the +63 µs
overhead (~67%)**.

## Recommended order (decode, bs16)
1. **in-MoE LoRA fold** — biggest structural win (~25 µs; **post-opt1/opt2 the remaining MoE-decomp
   extra is ~13 µs** = fused_moe 7.2 + activation 3.2 + permute 2.4, all fold-only — align/sort taken
   by opt1, topk/pack+elem by opt2). **bf16 is the NVFP4 sibling**, NOT FP8: both bf16 and NVFP4 are
   decomposed and hit the *missing-unfused-cubin wall*, so this is **NOT a port of `sgl_fp8_moe.py`**
   (FP8 isn't truly "folded" — it only keeps permute fused). NVFP4 gets the fold by fusing
   activation+quant (`launchFusedActivationQuant` → `activated_bf16` never hits HBM); **bf16 has no
   quant**, so the equivalent is **fuse SwiGLU+lora into the GEMM1 epilogue (CUTLASS-EVT, bf16-only)**
   — kills the standalone `permute` + the `activated_bf16` HBM round-trip (ref §5/§6).
2. **align/sort/scatter fusion** (~10 µs) — largest (a) item; fixed-cost at small batch → decode benefits
   disproportionately. ✅ **DONE — [opt1](https://github.com/yushengsu-thu/sglang/commit/869882a3ab87ec3c1983f8808d382ef2aa1d0cea): decode +11.0/9.9/8.8% (bs16/32/64), e2e −9%, prefill flat; `moe_align_block_size_small_batch` 384→0 launches.** See `opt1/`.
3. **topk+pack single launch** (~3 µs) + **drop elem/upcast / `_get_lora_info`** (~4 µs) — PR #27329 /
   team action items; cheap, additive.
   - **topk+pack ✅ DONE — opt2** (`SGLANG_OPT_LORA_FUSED_TOPK_PACK`, already wired/default-on): fuses
     `_pack_topk_for_flashinfer_routed` (cast/`<<16`/`|`) into the gating kernel → **decode +5.6%/3.6%/3.1%
     (bs16/32/64)**, `BinaryFunctor` 576→0, `bitwise` 12→0, total launches 24178→21874. See `opt2/`.
   - **drop elem/upcast / `_get_lora_info` — investigated & measured (opt3): no clear win**
     ([opt3](https://github.com/yushengsu-thu/lora_perf_lora_profile/tree/main/runs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-BF16-expert_shared-20260609-133913/opt3)).
     opt2 already removed the elem/copy bulk (the pack's cast/shift/or chain); residual
     activation-vec (`SGLANG_OPT_FUSED_MOE_ACTIVATION_VEC`) + lean `_get_lora_info` gains are within
     run-to-run noise (prefill ~±few %, decode ~0). Low-ROI; remaining copies live in the decomposed
     `.cu` op → the in-MoE fold. **Next real headroom: in-MoE fold (the big ① item).**

bs16 is latency / fixed-cost bound — which is why these small routing/align/elem kernels matter at
decode. allreduce excluded from GPU-active analysis (spin-wait inflated). Numbers are one steady
decode layer.
